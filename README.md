# Drug Discovery using Deep Learning & Neural Networks

## Section #1: Background, Introduction, Motivation

The motivation for this research project stems from the challenges faced today in the bio-medicine  and pharmaceutical field. The process of finding new drugs that cure a wide range of diseases has always been a key focus area in sciences and humanity. To give a brief sense of what the status quo looks like in the current drug discovery pipeline, drugs traditionally go through a pipeline from research inception to FDA approval and production over a span of around 12 years, with an average cost of $2.6 billion (Raval, 2018). A primary reason for this is attributed to the immense time requirements needed to test out all possible protein-ligand combinations in order to find a suitable candidate for an approved drug. After going through the entire process, it is said that “90% of all clinical trials still fail in humans trials, even after the drugs have been successfully tested in animals” (Raval, 2018).

These traditional processes can be described as knowledge-based, which not only require an immense amount of time in itself, but also generally rely on an exclusive set of knowledge that only a small circle of highly-trained medical professionals are privy to, in order to form new insights or make meaningful contributions. Even with new knowledge gained in bio-medicine, the rate at which we discover new drugs may only improve incrementally, simply due to the realistic limitations detailed. All in all, the amount of research work, money, and time that goes into drug discovery is astronomical.

## Potentials of Deep Learning:
With these existing challenges and obstacles in mind, deep learning offers a fundamentally new approach in tackling this age-old problem. Although, domain knowledge will no doubt still be critical in this field, artificial intelligence and neural networks, in particular, offer to at least take the grunt work of mindless trial-and-error out of the equation, and narrow down the list of candidates of drugs in much less time than previously deemed possible.

With recent advances in the deep learning field and also computational power, neural networks have the potential ability to recognize and predict the binding affinities of a particular protein-ligand pair. In other words, neural networks offer to be able to predict, at a relatively high accuracy, a subset of ligands that can act as potential drugs to common diseases - all at a significantly lower amount of human effort as compared to traditional knowledge-based approaches. 

This is one of the advantages of using neural networks’ ‘black-box’ approach. Due to the mathematical underpinnings involved – forward propagation, backward propagation, and gradient descent – the practitioner simply needs to feed in a relevant set of features into a model, let the model calculate the loss according to a defined loss function, and allow it to iteratively learn its parameters (weights and biases) through the process of backpropagation. This process repeats itself until the model reaches a local or global minimum point in the loss curve through gradient descent.

In the context of medicine, enormous amounts of time spent on research and testing, as well as technical domain knowledge in biomedicine and pharmacology, are no longer a baseline requirement to contribute to the field of drug discovery. All that is required is someone with the knowledge of deep learning techniques and access to large amounts of pharmaceutical data to input a set of features into a neural network and train it over time to recognize what ligands can bind effectively to which type of proteins. 

## Report Structure:
In this report, we will explore in detail how we can use deep learning techniques to train a network with available data to identify possible ligand-protein pairings that can potentially go further into the drug discovery pipeline. More specifically, we will look at data that is presented to us, which includes protein data in the form of Protein Data Bank files (PDB), which is a textual file format describing 3d structures of molecules; ligand data in the form of Simplified molecular-input line-entry (“SMILES”), which is a line notation that represents the chemical make-up of a ligand; and lastly, the centroid position in the form of x, y, z coordinates that describe the precise docking location on a protein that a ligand must bind into. The report will also go through the general pipeline used to clean and process the mentioned data, and specific methods, techniques, and hyper-parameters chosen in constructing the network model. Lastly, we will look at the training results, assumptions made, and lessons learned throughout the project.
